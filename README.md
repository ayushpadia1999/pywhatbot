Chatbot is a machine that interacts with humans and it provides information and messages to humans. We can safely say that we are in or at least entering the era of the chatbot. The big players, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others, are all busy developing and improving this innovative user experience technology. Messaging applications are now more widely used than social networks, which is good news for the chatbot as they are such messaging applications!
Every enterprise has expanded IT infrastructure. From different fields, on-premise to cloud, companies with different supply providers, run on many different, internal and characterized built applications, as well as ERP, encompass applications. There are other core applications like CRM and customer portals, which are the backbone of ERP.

We live in a corporate world so it is not surprising to see that more and more consumers are getting inclined to use chatbots. Of course,one might have to consider the human interaction that humans provide in chat service, but this conventional service from the human side has some limitations. This isn’t an issue with chatbots because of the wide range of services it provides and most importantly, the 24/7 availability.It would be wrong or ignorant to say that chatbots are evolving and their evolution will become complete in 2019.
Chatbots evolved in 2018 and are more intelligent as well as human than ever. There is no denying this fact. The successful adoption of chatbots by end-users has led to the use of more and more bots in advanced artificial intelligence technologies and their usage by a custom software development company. Even there are reports that 80–85% of businesses will be deploying advanced chatbots by 2021 Since most people don’t mind talking to a robot rather than an actual human (where studies have shown that 70% people would opt for messaging a bot to communicate with a company), it isn’t surprising that the future of these platform looks great and even for a custom software development company.
This bot can help companies in marketing their products and services by sending bulk messages to customers conveniently. It can also help deliver notices or information to a mass audience. It can also be helpful to schools and colleges in sending mass mails to the student regarding their academics and other curricular activities.
Be there for customers 24/7 on their preferred channels, and share messages and videos to customers as and when required. 
Lower costs for marketing 
Enrich your customer communication with different forms of media including images, videos, GIFs, and more.
The bot can share a message or any form of media via whatsapp to any number of users required.  
While WhatsApp was initially designed for private use, the need to expand its reach to support businesses quickly became apparent. Today your business can become easily contactable via WhatsApp plugins on their websites and run push marketing campaigns. And WhatsApp's created seamless integration options, making it just as simple to create a business WhatsApp presence as an individual would.

Future Scope:
I can implement AI to give specific answers to users as per their question. I can integrate real time chat and answer fetching directly from google using AI to be more specific on user query.
